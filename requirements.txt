# Independent Variable Generator - Requirements
# This project uses only Python standard library modules

# Python version requirement
# Requires Python >= 3.6

# Standard library modules used:
# - argparse (command line argument parsing)
# - random (random number generation)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - csv (CSV file reading and writing)
# - sys (system-specific parameters and functions)
# - tempfile (temporary file handling for tests)

# No external dependencies required
# All functionality is implemented using Python's built-in libraries

# For development and testing:
# No additional packages required

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
# 2. No pip install needed - uses only standard library
# 3. Run the program directly with: python func.py -o output_folder
