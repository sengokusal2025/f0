# Abstract Function Expression for Independent Variable Generator
# 抽象的関数表現

# This file contains the abstract mathematical representation of the 
# independent variable generation function used in this project.

# Function Definition:
# f0() represents the independent variable generation function
# that produces a set of random variables within a specified range.

# Formal Mathematical Expression:
# Let f0: ∅ → ℤⁿ where n ∈ ℕ and n ≥ 1
# f0() = {x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ} where xᵢ ∈ [1, 1000] ∩ ℤ

# In functional notation:
# f0() → (x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ)
# where each xᵢ is randomly selected from the discrete uniform distribution
# over the interval [1, 1000]

# Default behavior:
# f0() ≡ f0(5) = (x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅)

# Parametric form:
# f0(n) → (x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ) where n is the number of variables to generate

# Properties:
# - Domain: Empty set (no input parameters in basic form)
# - Codomain: Set of n-tuples of positive integers
# - Range: [1, 1000]ⁿ ∩ ℤⁿ
# - Distribution: Discrete uniform over [1, 1000]
# - Independence: Each xᵢ is independently generated

# Usage Context:
# The generated independent variables serve as input for mathematical functions:
# - y = f1(x) = 3*x - 1
# - y = f2(x) = -6*x + 4
# where x ∈ f0()

# Implementation Notes:
# This abstract function is implemented in func.py as generate_random_variables()
# The output is saved in CSV format with header 'x' for compatibility
# with the specification requirements.
